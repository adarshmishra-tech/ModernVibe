🎨 Customization Guide
ModernVibe Pro is built for ultimate flexibility. Here’s how to make it yours:
1. Theme & Color Palette
Edit styles.css for global theming:
:root {
  --primary-accent: #your-brand-indigo; /* Primary brand color */
  --secondary-accent: #your-brand-rose; /* Secondary accent */
  /* Add more variables */
}

Tool Tip: Use Adobe Color for harmonious palettes.
2. Typography
Update fonts in index.html:
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=YourFont:wght@200..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

For custom fonts, add to assets/fonts/:
@font-face {
  font-family: 'VibeFont';
  src: url('assets/fonts/vibefont.woff2') format('woff2');
  font-weight: 200 900;
}
body { font-family: 'VibeFont', sans-serif; }

3. Content & Layout

HTML Edits: Update index.html for hero, portfolio, or testimonial content.  
Portfolio: Swap images in assets/images/ and edit captions.  
Form Integration: Replace form action with your backend (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms).

4. Animations & Interactivity
Enhance scripts.js for custom effects:
const vibeObserver = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach((entry) => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      entry.target.classList.add('visible');
    }
  });
});
document.querySelectorAll('.vibe-animate').forEach((el) => vibeObserver.observe(el));

Customize animations in styles.css:
@keyframes vibeFade {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(30px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}
.vibe-animate { animation: vibeFade 0.6s ease-out; }

5. SEO & Performance

Meta Tags: Enhance index.html:

<meta name="keywords" content="ModernVibe Pro, premium theme, responsive design">
<meta property="og:title" content="ModernVibe Pro by Adarsh Mishra">


Image Optimization: Compress images with Squoosh.  
Lazy Loading: Use loading="lazy" on <img> tags.
