🎨 Customization Guide
ModernVibe Pro is built for effortless personalization. Follow these steps to tailor it to your vision:
1. Theme & Color Customization
Modify CSS variables in style.css:
.light-mode {
  --accent-primary: #your-color; /* e.g., #ff5733 */
  --accent-secondary: #your-color; /* e.g., #33d1ff */
  --bg-primary: linear-gradient(135deg, #e0e0e0, #f0f0f0);
}
.dark-mode {
  --accent-primary: #your-color; /* e.g., #66b2ff */
}


Tip: Use a color palette generator like Coolors.co for cohesive branding.

2. Typography Adjustments

Replace Google Fonts in index.html:<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=YourFont:wght@300;400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">


Update style.css to apply:body { font-family: 'YourFont', sans-serif; }



3. Content Updates

Text & Sections: Edit index.html to update hero text, service descriptions, or portfolio content.
Portfolio Images: Replace project1.jpg, project2.jpg, project3.jpg with your images (JPEG/PNG, ideally 1200x800px).
Form Action: Connect the contact form to a backend (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms):<form class="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/your-id" method="post">



4. Animation Enhancements

Modify animations in style.css:@keyframes slideInUp {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(50px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}
.hero-title { animation: slideInUp 1.2s ease; }


Add custom JS animations in theme.js:document.querySelectorAll('.custom-class').forEach(el => {
  el.style.transition = 'opacity 0.8s ease';
  el.style.opacity = '1';
});



5. SEO & Performance

Meta Tags: Enhance index.html:<meta name="keywords" content="premium theme, responsive, modern web">
<meta property="og:title" content="ModernVibe Pro">


Image Optimization: Compress images with TinyPNG before adding to the directory.
Lazy Loading: Add to portfolio images:<img src="project1.jpg" alt="Project One" loading="lazy">
